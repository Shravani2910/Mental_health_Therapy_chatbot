## 💡 About the Project

This project combines principles of **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** with **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to create a chatbot that simulates basic therapeutic conversations.

It provides:
- Sentiment-aware responses
- Basic CBT interventions (thought-challenging, journaling prompts, etc.)
- A supportive and private environment for users to express their emotions

The chatbot is **not a replacement for professional therapy**, but a supplementary digital companion to support mental well-being.
